# FreeRTOS from Analog Devices
This repository contains a copy of the FreeRTOS Real-Time Operating System with additional components from Analog Devices.
All FreeRTOS source code is provided as-is, unpacked an unmodified from the original FreeRTOS source zip/repositories unless explicitly stated.

## Why Is The Master Branch Empty
This repository is used to provide users of Analog Devices DSP and Microcontrollers with an easy way to access the ports of FreeRTOS for their processors.
The branches in this repository relate to specific releases of FreeRTOS from FreeRTOS.org (9.0.0., 10.0.0 etc) with tags indicating formal releases of the additional Analog devices content (REL-FRTOS-ADI-1.2.0 etc).
The following releases from Analog devices are currently available in this repository:

1.2.0 (based on FreeRTOS v9.0.0)
  Support for ADuCM302x, ADuCM4x5x, ADSP-BF7xx and ADSP-SC5xx (Cortex-A) processors.

## Licensing
Licensing is release specific. Please refer to the LICENSE.md file on each branch for more details.
