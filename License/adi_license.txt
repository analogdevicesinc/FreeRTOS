Portions Copyright (c) 1997-2021 Analog Devices, Inc. All rights reserved.

This Software License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legal agreement between Analog Devices, 
Inc., a Massachusetts corporation, with its principal office at One Analog Way, Wilmington, MA 
01887, U.S.A. ("Analog Devices") and you (personally or on behalf of your employer, as applicable) 
("Licensee") for the software and related documentation that accompanies this Agreement (the 
"Licensed Software"). YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING OR USING
THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY OR USE 
THE SOFTWARE. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OVER THE AGE OF 18 AND HAVE THE 
CAPACITY AND AUTHORITY TO BIND YOURSELF OR YOUR EMPLOYER, AS APPLICABLE, 
TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
The Licensed Software consists of (a) embedded software (including firmware) designed to operate 
in an Analog Devices processor / product ("Embedded Software") and/or (b) application software 
designed to run on personal computers ("PC Software"). 

1. Licenses. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Analog Devices grants to 
Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license, to:
(a) internally use and copy the Embedded Software (and modify the Embedded Software if it is 
provided in source code form) for the sole purpose of incorporating the Embedded Software into 
Analog Devices processors/products incorporated into Licensee products; and
(b) internally use and copy the PC Software for the sole purpose of configuring, monitoring and 
controlling Analog Devices processors/products or otherwise using the PC Software with Analog 
Devices processors/products.

2. Distribution of Embedded Software. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
Analog Devices grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable license, 
to copy and distribute the Embedded Software in object code form solely for use in Analog Devices 
processors/products incorporated into Licensee products. Distribution is limited to Embedded 
Software in object code form that is incorporated into Licensee products. 

3. License to Analog Devices. During the term of this Agreement Licensee grants to Analog 
Devices (and its affiliates), under any and all Licensee patents (and those of its affiliates), a 
nonexclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to make, use, sell, import, export, copy, 
distribute and otherwise exploit the Licensed Software in-whole or in-part (including updated 
versions of the Licensed Software), and to directly or indirectly sublicense others to do the same. 

4. Restrictions. Licensee shall not modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or create 
derivative works of the Licensed Software (except and only to the extent that such activity is 
expressly permitted (i) pursuant to Section 1 above or (ii) by applicable law notwithstanding this 
limitation). Licensee may only copy the Licensed Software as expressly authorized in Sections 1 
and 2 above. In no event shall Licensee sublicense, rent, lease, permit time-sharing or otherwise 
make available, transfer, deliver, disclose, or distribute the Licensed Software to any third party 
(except as expressly authorized with respect to the delivery of the Embedded Software under 
Section 2 above). The Licensed Software may not be used with any processors/products other 
than Analog Devices processors/products or for any other purpose. To the extent there are any 
specifications and/or user manuals for the Licensed Software, as an additional restriction under 
this Agreement (and in no way expanding any rights under this Agreement), the Licensed Software 
may not be used in any manner that is inconsistent with such specifications and/or user manuals. 
For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Licensee may not distribute the Embedded Software except as 
embedded in Analog Devices processors/products that are incorporated into Licensee products
(Licensee may not distribute the Embedded Software separately from Analog Devices 
processors/products incorporated into Licensee products) and (ii) Licensee may not distribute the 
PC Software under any circumstances. 
Licensee shall not engage in any activities with respect to the Licensed Software that would cause 
the Licensed Software, in whole or in part to become subject to any terms of an Excluded License. 
An "Excluded License" means any license, including licenses for "open source" code (such as 
defined by the Free Software Foundation), that requires as a condition of use, modification, and/or 
distribution of the software subject to such Excluded License, that such software or other software 
combined and/or distributed with such software be (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; 
(ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge. 
Examples of Excluded Licenses include, without limitation, the GNU General Public License, the 
GNU Lesser General Public License, the Mozilla Public License and the Microsoft Reciprocal
License. The restrictions of this section apply regardless of whether the Licensed Software is 
intended or designed to run in an environment that includes software under an Excluded License. 
Any license, agreement or other document issued, entered into or granted by Licensee that 
purports to apply any Excluded License to any portion of the Licensed Software shall be null and 
void with regard to the Licensed Software. Under no circumstances will Licensee offer, provide, 
distribute, or license any of the Licensed Software (whether in source code form or object code 
form) under any form of Excluded License. 
Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Analog Devices and its licensors and suppliers (as 
applicable) retain all right, title and interest in the Licensed Software and derivative works thereof,
including all related patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights in any of the foregoing, 
and that Licensee's rights to the Licensed Software are limited to those expressly provided for in 
Sections 1 and 2 above (subject to the conditions and restrictions in this Section 4). Licensee shall 
not take any action inconsistent with such title and ownership. Any use of the Licensed Software 
for any purpose other than as expressly licensed hereunder is outside the scope of this Agreement. 
It is agreed that because of the proprietary nature of the Licensed Software, Analog Devices' 
remedies at law for a breach by the Licensee of its obligations under this License or for use of the 
Licensed Software beyond the scope of the license granted herein will be inadequate and that 
Analog Devices will, in the event of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive 
relief, without the posting of any bond, in addition to all other remedies provided under this License 
or available at law.
If Analog Devices elects to make any update, upgrade or new version of the Licensed Software 
("Updates") available to Licensee, such Updates shall be deemed to be the Licensed Software
under this Agreement. If requested by Analog Devices, Licensee shall only use the latest version 
of the Licensed Software (including Updates). Analog Devices shall have no obligation to provide 
support or Updates of any kind.
In no event shall Licensee remove any copyright or other intellectual property notice or other legend 
contained on or in copies of the Licensed Software or displayed by the Licensed Software.

5. Publicity. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, Licensee may not use any trademark or 
trade name of Analog Devices or make any public announcement regarding the existence of this 
Agreement without Analog Devices' prior written consent. Licensee may not publish or provide the 
results of any benchmark or comparison tests run on the Licensed Software to any third party 
without the prior written consent of Analog Devices. 

6. Feedback. Licensee may from time to time provide modifications, enhancements, 
improvements, code, suggestions, ideas, comments or other feedback ("Feedback") to Analog 
Devices related to the Licensed Software. Licensee agrees that all Feedback is and shall be given 
entirely voluntarily. To the extent Licensee provides such Feedback, Licensee (on behalf of itself 
and its affiliates) hereby grants to Analog Devices and its affiliates a non-exclusive, irrevocable, 
perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable license, with the right to sublicense, under 
Licensee's (and its affiliates') intellectual property, to use and disclose Feedback in any manner 
Analog Devices or its affiliates choose, including, without limitation, displaying, performing, copying, 
making, having made, using, selling and otherwise disposing of Analog Devices' and its affiliates
and their respective licensees' products embodying such Feedback in any manner and via any 
media, without reference to its source or other obligation to Licensee and even if the Feedback is 
designated as confidential.

7. Confidentiality. 
(a) The Licensed Software and any accompanying documentation, and any other information which 
a reasonable person would understand is of a confidential or proprietary nature, shall be deemed 
to be "Confidential Information" of Analog Devices whether or not it is identified in writing as 
"Confidential." Any other materials or information identified by Analog Devices as "Confidential" or 
with any similar notice shall also be treated as Confidential Information of Analog Devices under 
this Agreement. Analog Devices Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, software 
and information of Analog Devices' affiliates, suppliers and licensors. 
(b) Licensee shall protect the confidentiality of Analog Devices Confidential Information. Without 
limitation, Licensee agrees: (i) not to disclose or otherwise permit any other person or entity access 
to, in any manner, Confidential Information, or any part thereof in any form whatsoever; except that 
such disclosure or access shall be permitted to an employee of Licensee (x) requiring access to 
Confidential Information in the course of his or her employment in connection with this Agreement, 
(y) who is subject to written confidentiality obligations at least as protective with respect to 
Confidential Information as the terms and conditions in this Agreement and (z) who complies with 
all other applicable provisions of this Agreement; (ii) to notify Analog Devices promptly and in writing 
of the circumstances surrounding any suspected possession, use or knowledge of Confidential 
Information other than those authorized by this Agreement; and (iii) not to use Confidential 
Information for any purpose other than as explicitly set forth herein.
(c) Nothing in this Section 7 shall restrict Licensee with respect to information if such information: 
(i) was rightfully possessed by Licensee before it was received from Analog Devices; (ii) is 
independently developed by Licensee without reference to Confidential Information; (iii) is 
subsequently furnished to Licensee by a third party not under any obligation of confidentiality with 
respect to such information, and without restrictions on use or disclosure; or (iv) is or becomes 
public or available to the general public otherwise than through any act or default of Licensee.
(d) Because the unauthorized use, transfer or dissemination of any Confidential Information may 
diminish substantially the value of such materials and may irreparably harm Analog Devices, if 
Licensee breaches the provisions of this Section 7, Analog Devices shall, without limiting its other 
rights or remedies, be entitled to equitable relief, including but not limited to injunctive relief.

8. Fees and Taxes. Licensee shall pay Analog Devices all applicable fees (if any) arising in 
connection with this Agreement. All fees are due within thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of 
the Licensed Software. Any late payments shall incur interest at the rate of one and one-half 
percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate allowed under applicable law, whichever is less. 
Licensee shall reimburse Analog Devices for all costs of collection. Licensee shall pay all foreign, 
federal, state, municipal and other governmental excise, sales, use, property, customs, import, 
value added and other taxes, fees, levies and duties of any nature now in force or enacted in the 
future that are assessed upon or with respect to the Licensed Software, but excluding taxes based 
on Analog Devices' net income.

9. Third Party Software. The Licensed Software may be accompanied by or include software made 
available by one or more third parties ("Third Party Software"). Each portion of Third Party Software 
is subject to its own separate software license terms and conditions ("Third Party Licenses"). The 
Third Party Licenses for Third Party Software delivered with the Licensed Software may be set forth 
or identified (by URL or otherwise) in (i) Appendix A to this license (if any), (ii) the applicable 
software header or footer text, (iii) a text file located in the directory of the applicable Third Party 
Software component, (iv) software documentation, (v) in connection with any Update of the 
Licensed Software or its documentation, and/or (vi) such other location customarily used for 
licensing terms. The use of each portion of Third Party Software is subject to the Third Party 
Licenses, and Licensee agrees that Licensee's use of any Third Party Software is bound by the 
applicable Third Party License. Licensee agrees to review and comply with all applicable Third 
Party Licenses prior to any use or distribution of any Third Party Software. Third Party Software is 
provided on an "as is" basis without any representation, warranty or liability of any kind. Analog 
Devices (including its licensors and suppliers) shall have no liability or responsibility for the 
operation or performance of the Third Party Software and shall not be liable for any damages, 
costs, or expenses, direct or indirect, arising out of the performance or failure to perform of the 
Third Party Software. Analog Devices (including its licensors and suppliers) shall be entitled to the 
benefit of any and all limitations of liability and disclaimers of warranties contained in the Third Party 
Licenses. 

10. Required Consents; Indemnification. Licensee acknowledges that use or distribution of the 
Licensed Software may require Licensee to obtain licenses to intellectual property or other 
consents from one or more third parties. Licensee is responsible for obtaining any and all such 
required licenses or consents regarding the Licensed Software and for the performance of any and 
all required tests or analysis necessary or appropriate for the determination of the suitability of the 
Licensed Software for its or its customers' purposes. Without limitation, Licensee is responsible 
for obtaining, maintaining and complying with third party licenses in connection with any Industry 
Standard hereafter defined below (including related intellectual property rights) applicable to the 
Licensed Software. "Industry Standard" means any standard, protocol or specification that is 
promulgated by any standards development organization, consortium, trade association, special 
interest group, or like group or entity, for the purpose of widespread adoption. By way of nonlimiting
 examples, industry standards and specifications may include without limitation technical 
specifications promulgated by organizations such as the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU), International Standards Organization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission 
(IEC), 3'd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), World 
Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), OpenFabrics Alliance, 
Open Mobile Alliance, UPnP Forum, USB lmplementers Forum, Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Telecommunications 
Industry Association (TIA), AUTomotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR), High-bandwidth 
Digital Content Protection (HDCP), High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), Digital 
Transmission Content Protection (DTCP), Digital Transmission Licensing Administrator (DTLA), 
and Ethernet POWERLINK Standardization Group (EPSG). Licensee shall defend, indemnify and 
hold Analog Devices, its affiliates, licensors and suppliers, and their respective officers, directors, 
employees and agents (each an "Indemnified Party") harmless from and against any damages, 
fines, penalties, assessments, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees 
and court costs) in the event that any claim is brought against an Indemnified Party arising or 
alleged to arise directly or indirectly from (i) Licensee's possession, use, distribution or other 
exploitation of the Licensed Software or Third Party Software, or (ii) Licensee's failure to obtain any 
required license or consent with respect to the Licensed Software or Third Party Software. 

11. Reporting; Audit. If requested by Analog Devices, Licensee shall report to Analog Devices by 
emailing licensing@analog.com within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter (i) the name of 
each Licensee product which contains the Licensed Software, (ii) the quantity of such Licensee 
products used or distributed by Licensee and the number of instances of the Licensed Software 
executing on each such Licensee product and (iii) such other information as Analog Devices may 
reasonably request related to use of the Licensed Software. Analog Devices shall have the right 
upon ten (10) days prior written notice to audit Licensee's compliance with the terms of this 
Agreement during normal business hours. In connection with such audit, Analog Devices shall 
have access to all reasonably requested documents, equipment, information and personnel. 
Licensee shall maintain complete and accurate records of its use of the Licensed Software for a 
period of at least three (3) years from the applicable use of the Licensed Software. If requested by 
Analog Devices, within ten business days of such request, Licensee shall either (i) certify in writing 
that Licensee is fully compliant with this Agreement or (ii) deliver a notice in writing stating all of the 
reasons why Licensee is not fully compliant. 

12. License Term; Term of Agreement. This Agreement is effective upon receipt of the Licensed 
Software and shall continue for three (3) years, unless earlier terminated as permitted in this 
Agreement. This Agreement will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms unless 
indicated otherwise in writing by either of the parties thirty (30) days prior to any renewal date. 
Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving written notice to Analog Devices. If 
a software license fee was not charged by Analog Devices and paid by Licensee for the Licensed 
Software in connection with this Agreement, Analog Devices may terminate this Agreement at any 
time for any reason. This Agreement may be terminated by either party immediately in the event 
any assignment is made by the other party for the benefit of creditors, or if a receiver, trustee in 
bankruptcy or similar officer shall be appointed to take charge of any or all of the other party's 
property, or if the other party files a voluntary petition under federal bankruptcy laws or similar state 
statutes or an involuntary petition is filed against the other party and is not dismissed within sixty 
(60) days. Analog Devices may immediately terminate this Agreement or any licenses granted 
hereunder by written notice to Licensee in the event that (a) any related license from a licensor or
supplier to Analog Devices terminates or expires or no longer authorizes Analog Devices to 
distribute and/or license the applicable software or (b) there is a claim or allegation of intellectual 
property infringement based on the Licensed Software or such a claim is reasonably possible as 
determined by Analog Devices in its sole discretion; provided that, if Analog Devices terminates 
this Agreement or any license pursuant to this sentence, Analog Devices shall refund a portion of 
the amounts paid (if any) under this Agreement for the affected portion of the Licensed Software in 
an amount reflecting the value of the affected portion of the Licensed Software as determined by 
Analog Devices in its sole discretion (the value of the Licensed Software shall be depreciated on a 
three year straight-line basis). This Agreement shall immediately automatically terminate in the 
event of any failure by Licensee to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement. In the 
event of termination or expiration (i) all licenses granted to Licensee immediately expire and (ii) 
Licensee must immediately cease using the Licensed Software and permanently delete all copies 
of the Licensed Software and all of its component parts, including any backup or archival copies. 
The provisions of Sections 3 through 22 shall survive any termination or expiration of this 
Agreement according to their terms.

13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AND THIRD PARTY 
SOFTWARE AND ANY SUPPORT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND ANALOG DEVICES, FOR ITSELF AND ITS AFFILIATES,
HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AND THIRD 
PARTY SOFTWARE AND ANY SUPPORT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY EXPRESS 
OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY; FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE; QUALITY AND ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT; NONINFRINGEMENT; QUIET ENJOYMENT; AND TITLE. LICENSEE AGREES THAT ANY EFFORTS 
BY ANALOG DEVICES OR ITS AFFILIATES TO MODIFY OR UPDATE THE LICENSED 
SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR PROVIDE SUPPORT SHALL NOT BE 
DEEMED A WAIVER OF THESE LIMITATIONS, AND THAT ANY ANALOG DEVICES
WARRANTIES SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE FAILED OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 

14. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANALOG DEVICES
(INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM 
OR RELATED TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, THEIR USE OR 
ANY RELATED INFORMATION AND/OR SUPPORT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY 
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR 
ANALOGOUS DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES RESULTING 
FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA, REVENUE, PROFITS, OR SAVINGS, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR 
ANY OTHER CAUSE), UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION 
CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT OR PRODUCT LIABILITY), EVEN IF 
IT HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
IN NO EVENT SHALL ANALOG DEVICES' CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO 
LICENSEE FOR ANY AND ALL CAUSES WHATSOEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF 
ANY CLAIMS OR ACTIONS, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (1) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS 
($100.00 U.S.) OR (2) THE AMOUNT PAID TO ANALOG DEVICES HEREUNDER FOR THE 
LICENSED SOFTWARE. ANALOG DEVICES' AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS
SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OR ITS USE.
Some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential, incidental 
or other damages, and, as such, some portion of the above limitation may not apply to Licensee. 
In such jurisdictions, Analog Devices' liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

15. HIGH RISK APPLICATIONS. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED OR
INTENDED FOR USE IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE 
PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR 
FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR CONTROL SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, 
LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, WEAPONS SYSTEMS, AUTONOMOUS DRIVING OR OTHER 
SAFETY CRITICAL AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS, OR ANY OTHER APPLICATION IN WHICH 
THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY 
OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES ("HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES"). THE 
LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED OR WARRANTED TO BE SUITABLE FOR USE IN 
CONNECTION WITH HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. USE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IN 
CONNECTION WITH HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE FULLY AT LICENSEE'S
RISK. 

16. Choice of Law. This Agreement and any dispute related to the Licensed Software shall be 
governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America, without 
reference to its principles of conflicts of laws, and, as to matters affecting copyrights, trademarks 
and patents, in addition, by applicable United States federal law. The parties agree that the 
jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to this Agreement shall be in a court of competent 
subject matter jurisdiction located in Boston, Massachusetts, and each of the parties hereby agrees 
to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purpose of any such 
action, except that Analog Devices may seek equitable (including injunctive) relief and enforce 
judgements in any venue of its choosing. Licensee hereby submits to personal jurisdiction in such 
courts. The parties hereto specifically exclude the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act from this 
Agreement. The parties hereto waive any statute, law, or regulation that might provide an 
alternative law or forum or to have this Agreement written in any language other than English.

17. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If the Licensed Software or documentation provided by 
Analog Devices or its suppliers is procured by or on behalf of the United States Government, the 
Government agrees that such software or documentation is "commercial computer software" or
"commercial computer software documentation" and that absent a written agreement to the 
contrary, the Government's rights with respect to such Licensed Software or documentation are 
limited by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to FAR § 12.212(a) and/or DFARS § 227.7202-
1(a), as applicable.

18. Export. Licensee shall only use the Licensed Software in compliance with all applicable laws 
and regulations, including without limitation export control laws. Licensee agrees that Licensee will 
not directly or indirectly export the Licensed Software to another country except in full compliance 
with all applicable United States Federal Laws and Regulations and other laws and regulations 
relating to exports and imports. Licensee will not export/re-export, directly or indirectly, any 
software, information or technical data acquired under this Agreement or the "direct product" 
thereof to any country for which the United States Government or any agency thereof, at the time 
of export, requires an export license or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such 
license or approval. The term "direct product" as used herein means the immediate product 
(including processes and services) produced directly by the use of the technical data or 
information. In addition to the above, the Licensed Software and/or any "direct product" thereof, 
may not be used by, or exported, transferred or re-exported to (i) any U.S. or U.N. or EU-sanctioned 
or embargoed country, or to nationals or residents of such countries; (ii) any person , entity, 
organization, or other party identified on the U.S. Department of Treasury's lists of "Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons" (iii) any associations, individuals, companies, entities, 
organizations found in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders or Entity List, 
as published and revised from time to time (collectively known as the "Denied Parties List" or 
"Prohibited Parties List"); and/or (iv) any unauthorized or prohibited end-user engaged in any 
prohibited activities related to weapons of mass destruction, including without limitation, activities 
related to the design, development, production or use of nuclear weapons, materials, or facilities, 
missile or the support of missile projects, and chemical or biological weapons. Licensee 
understands that the foregoing obligations are legal requirements and agree that they shall survive 
any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

19. Compliance with Laws. Licensee shall comply with all laws, legislation, rules, regulations, 
governmental requirements and industry standards with respect to the Licensed Software, and the 
performance by Licensee of its obligations hereunder, existing in any applicable jurisdiction. In the 
event that this Agreement is required to be registered with any governmental authority, Licensee 
shall notify Analog Devices in writing and cause such registration to be made and shall bear any 
expense or tax payable in respect thereof. 

20. Assignment. This Agreement is personal to Licensee and Licensee may not transfer, 
sublicense, lease, rent, or assign its rights under this License, and any such attempt shall be null 
and void. Analog Devices may assign, transfer, or sublicense this Agreement or any rights or 
obligations hereunder at any time in its sole discretion.

21. Waiver; Modification; Severability. No waiver, consent, modification or change of terms of this 
Agreement shall bind either party unless in writing signed by both parties, and then such waiver, 
consent, modification or change shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific 
purpose given. If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, such provision shall be 
enforced to the extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will remain in 
effect.

22. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire, final, and complete agreement 
between the parties hereto relevant to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all other 
agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this 
Agreement. Any term or condition incorporated in Licensee's purchase order(s) or any other 
document provided by Licensee to Analog Devices which is in any way different from, inconsistent 
with or in addition to the terms and conditions set forth herein shall be of no effect, shall not apply 
to the licensing of the Licensed Software, and shall not become a part of a contract between the 
parties or be binding upon Analog Devices. Analog Devices' failure to object to terms contained in 
any communication from Licensee shall not be an acceptance of such terms or a waiver of the 
terms set forth in this Agreement. If, for any reason, any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, 
such invalidity shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall continue 
in force and effect to the full extent allowed by law. For the avoidance of doubt, all the Licensed 
Software under this Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and not 
any agreement or terms for purchase of Analog Devices products, even if the Licensed Software 
is delivered with such products.
